# 🎮 Number Guessing Game (Java CLI)

A fun and interactive command-line **Number Guessing Game** written in **Java** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, complete with **colorful terminal output** using ANSI escape codes.

---

## 🧠 Game Objective

The program randomly picks a number between a specified range (default: 1 to 100), and the player has to guess it. After each guess, the program gives hints:

- 🔺 "Too high!"
- 🔻 "Too low!"
- ✅ "Congratulations!" when guessed correctly.

---

## 🛠 Features

- 🎨 Colorful output with ANSI escape codes
- ♻️ Replayable without restarting the program
- 🧼 Input validation for both numbers and strings
- 🧠 Object-Oriented structure with clean code separation
- 💻 Fully terminal-based; no GUI required
